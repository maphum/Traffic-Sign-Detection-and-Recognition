# Traffic-Sign-Detection-and-Recognition

An assistant can help driver recognize traffic sign on the road. It can detect very small traffic sign and classify what kind of that sign is. 

I used Retinanet model to detect traffic sign and both VGG19 and MobileNet models to classify kind of that sign. All I code in Python.
